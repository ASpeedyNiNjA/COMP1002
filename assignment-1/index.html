		<!--Verse I-->
		<p>	
		Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry<br>
		You don't know how lovely you are<br>
		I had to find you, tell you I need you<br>
		Tell you I set you apart<br>
		</p>

		<!-- Pre-chorus I -->
		<p>
			Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions<br>
			Oh, let's go back to the start<br>
			Running in circles, coming up tails<br>
			Heads on a science apart<br>
		</p>

		<!-- Chorus -->
		<p>
			Nobody said it was easy<br>
			It's such a shame for us to part<br>
			Nobody said it was easy<br>
			No one ever said it would be this hard<br>
			Oh, take me back to the start<br>
		</p>

		<!-- Verse II -->
		<p>
			I was just guessing at numbers and figures<br>
			Pulling the puzzles apart<br>
			Questions of science, science and progress<br>
			Do not speak as loud as my heart<br>
			But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me<br>
			Oh and I rush to the start<br>
		</p>

		<!-- Pre-Chorus II -->
		<p>
			Running in circles, chasing our tails<br>
			Coming back as we are<br>
		</p>

		<!-- Chorus -->
		<p>
			Nobody said it was easy<br>
			Oh, it's such a shame for us to part<br>
			Nobody said it was easy<br>
			No one ever said it would be so hard<br>
			I'm going back to the start<br>
